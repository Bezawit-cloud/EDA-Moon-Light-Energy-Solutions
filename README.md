# MoonLight Energy Solutions – Solar Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes solar radiation data from **Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo** to identify high-potential regions for solar installation. The goal is to support MoonLight Energy Solutions’ mission of enhancing operational efficiency and sustainability through data-driven solar investments.

The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and cross-country comparisons to provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Objectives

- Identify trends in solar irradiance and environmental factors across countries.  
- Compare key metrics (GHI, DNI, DHI) to assess solar potential.  
- Highlight countries with the most consistent and highest solar energy availability.  
- Provide recommendations for targeted solar installations aligned with sustainability goals.

## Key Insights

- **Benin** shows the highest mean GHI (**229.83 W/m²**), suggesting strong overall solar potential. However, the high standard deviation (**321.64**) indicates significant variability in solar irradiance.  
- **Sierra Leone** has the lowest mean GHI (**196.44 W/m²**) with moderate variability, indicating less consistent solar potential compared to Benin and Togo.  
- **Togo** matches Benin in mean GHI (**229.83 W/m²**) and shows similar variability, suggesting comparable solar potential.  
- **Statistical Testing:** Both ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis tests returned **p-values of 0.0**, confirming that differences in GHI between the countries are statistically significant.  

**Insight:**  
Benin and Togo are top candidates for solar installation based on average irradiance, but Benin may require strategies to manage variability. Sierra Leone has lower solar potential but may still be suitable for smaller-scale projects.

## Approach

1. **Data Profiling and Cleaning:** Handled missing values, outliers, and sensor irregularities.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Examined solar radiation, temperature, humidity, and wind patterns through visualizations and statistical summaries.  
3. **Cross-Country Comparison:** Compared Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo using boxplots, summary statistics, and significance testing.  
4. **Strategic Recommendations:** Prioritized countries for solar installation based on solar potential and variability.  

---

## Recommendations

- Focus solar investments on **Benin and Togo**, where average irradiance is high and consistent.  
- Design strategies to **mitigate variability** in solar production, especially for Benin.  
- Consider smaller-scale or targeted projects in Sierra Leone while monitoring solar potential trends.
